// In this activity, you are going to be creating your own Ben and Jerry's App where
// users can see all of the different flavors Ben and Jerry's have to offer
// while also getting specific information on a flavor by searching for it within the URL.

// Do not use MySQL for this assignment! Use the icecreams variable above as your data.
// Add the variable to your server.js file.

// Using handlebars and express, create a route called /icecream/:name. When the route is hit,
// it will display the name, price and awesomeness for that specific ice cream.

// Create an /icecreams route. It will loop over all the ice creams and display them all to the user.
