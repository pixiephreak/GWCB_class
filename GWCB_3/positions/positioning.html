<!-- Instructions:

Work with the same or different partners on this activity, but make sure each member of the group is typing out their own code!

Create a file called positioning.html and a file called positioning.css.

Using HTML/CSS, create the layout shown on the screen.

For reference, the colors used on the screen are #eee and #999.

For further reference, you can generate paragraphs of lorem ipsum text using http://www.lipsum.com/feed/html. You need to make this page scroll to see how the fixed position element behaves.

HINT: Use the code from the last few activities to help get you started. -->
